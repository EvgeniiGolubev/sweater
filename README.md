Social network training project (Twitter parody)
<p>The project is built with authorization and access rights based on roles. Registration in the application is built by sending an email to the user. 
The work used technologies such as Maven, Spring MVC, Spring Security, junit, JPA, FreeMarker, postgresql and flywaydb. 
While working with the project, I gained experience in setting up a virtual Linux server with the subsequent deployment of the application to it.
